Pig Game is a simple two-player dice game simulator.

## How to play
- Clone the repository and open the index.html page to start the game
- The first player to reach 100 points wins 
- Roll the dice to accumulate points
- Click the "Hold" button to add the current points to the total score and end your turn
- The trick is to avoid rolling a 1, which causes you to loose all the current points
